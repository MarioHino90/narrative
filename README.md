# CSV Uploader Tool

This CSV Uploader Tool is designed to map CSV file uploads to a specified database structure, allowing for dynamic adjustment to different CSV headers and database schemas. The application is built with Django and React, uses SQLite for the database, and can be easily set up and run using Docker.

For example, letâ€™s say the input data is:

![alt text](./description/image.png)

(This is just an example CSV, the input data could have different headers)

The database structure is

![alt text](./description/image-1.png)

Example result from a mapping:

![alt text](./description/image-2.png)

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Users can upload CSV files with varying headers.
- **Dynamic Mapping Interface**: A simple UI allows users to map CSV columns to database fields.
- **Data Storage**: Mapped data is stored in an SQLite database.
- **Docker Integration**: The entire application can be run using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.
